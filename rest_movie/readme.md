Movie Ticket Booking API
Overview
This API allows users and administrators to manage and book movie tickets. It supports various operations, including user authentication, ticket booking, movie management, and more. The API provides different functionalities based on user rolesâ€”authorized users can book tickets, while administrators have the ability to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the movie database.
